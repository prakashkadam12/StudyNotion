# StudyNotion: An Ed-Tech Application

## Overview

The most intricate project I've undertaken in full-stack development is called "StudyNotion," which encompasses two distinct portalsâ€”one for administrators and the other for students. Both administrators and students can register and log in initially.

## Features
- **Landing Page:** Features a button to explore available courses.
- **Course List Page:** Displays available courses with basic information.
- **Course Details Page:** Shows detailed information about a specific course.

## Design Decisions

- **Frontend:** Designed a simple and intuitive user interface using React.js and Tailwind CSS to enhance user experience.
- **Backend:** Implemented a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js to handle data retrieval and manipulation.
- **Database:** Utilized MongoDB to store course data, providing flexibility and scalability for future enhancements.

## Project Description

### Admin Portal

Administrators have comprehensive functionalities, including:

- **Course Creation:** Administrators can create courses, incorporating various multimedia elements such as videos and images directly related to the course content.
- **Payment Integration:** Administrators can integrate payment gateways, enabling seamless transactions for course purchases.
- **Course Publishing:** Once courses are curated and customized, administrators have the capability to publish them for sale to the student base.
- **Profile Management:** Administrators can manage their personal information through the settings interface, ensuring data accuracy and security.

### Student Portal

Students have an intuitive interface to manage their profiles and educational journeys, including:

- **Profile Management:** Students can create and update their personal information through the settings option, ensuring their data is current and relevant.
- **Course Purchase:** The highlight feature of the student portal is the ability to purchase courses seamlessly. This is facilitated by an innovative feature where students can utilize a scanner to purchase courses, streamlining the entire transaction process and enhancing user experience.
